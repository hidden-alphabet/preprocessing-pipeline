# TODOs:

- Make Scala implementation
- Add more examples
- Add Dask .py file

# notebooks

In notebooks you will find an example notebook comparing compute times for Dask and Pandas. Spoiler: Pandas is slow!

Also will include some pure `python` implementations of streaming data with either Twitter API or Reddit API

# scala

All of the `scala` work is done here. Nothing else to say about that for now.

# examples

Self explanatory.
